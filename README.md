Note:
The C++ files work with the C++ version of Windows' WPF framework. The JavaScript files were written with Node.js, and the API key will not work; you will need to make your own key at developer.clashroyale.com. Once you do, you will have to manually run the functions, since they were not designed to all be done within the same single execution of the program.

The STL files uses non-user defined unordered map and map providing the same functionality at faster speeds and with better error handling.
